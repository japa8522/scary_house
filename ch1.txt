# Scary House

A test book. A long long time ago....

There was a king in Rampur. He was aclaimed for his bravery against Nagas, and had won multiple battles against them.

He had a daughter named 'Aarya'. Aarya, the princess, has same bravery. She was as brave as a ray of sun. She was as beautiful as rising sun on a sunny day.
This is a great book.
